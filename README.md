# Network_Monitor
-----------------------------------------------------
This script can be utilized in several network monitoring and troubleshooting scenarios. Here are some examples:

    Network Troubleshooting: If you're experiencing network issues, you could use this script to gather information that could help identify the problem. For instance, high bandwidth utilization, high CPU or memory usage on a network device, or a high number of packet drops could all indicate network issues.

    Network Performance Monitoring: Regularly running this script could help you track the performance of your network over time. This could help you identify any potential issues before they become serious problems, and could also help you understand how your network usage changes at different times.

    Security Monitoring: The script could help identify potential security issues. For instance, if you notice an unexpected device generating a lot of network traffic (a "top talker"), it could indicate a compromised device or a device that is running malicious software.

    Learning and Education: If you're learning about networks, this script could be a practical tool to understand SNMP, NetFlow, and other network monitoring and troubleshooting techniques. You could run the script in a safe, controlled environment (like a personal lab or a virtual network) to see how it works.

    Network Audit and Inventory: With added features like port scanning and OS fingerprinting, this script could be used to audit a network, helping you understand what devices are on the network, what services they are running, and what operating systems they are using. This can be helpful for network management and planning, as well as for security audits.
